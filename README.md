# RPiPWM

This application was initially started to get a feel for using Pi-Blaster based Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) on the RaspberryPi. It worked so well that I ended up expanding things to work not only as an example of possible uses, but as a listening daemon for remote controlling the PWM pins. The code was written with Adafruit's analog LED strips in mind, but should be easily adaptable to any PWM functionality. [Pi-Blaster](https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster) is required and must be running in order to function. **Caveat:** This code is not hardened to attack and I do not recommend exposing the UDP interface to outside traffic without significant additional data integrity checks and rate limiters.

## Building pwmdemo

* Make a build folder and change to that folder
* Run cmake against the RPiPWM folder: cmake /full/path/to/RPiPWM
* Run make

## Usage

The pwmdemo app can accept multiple command line parameters. All parameters are optional and are set in the format of "--parameter[=value]":

| Parameter | Values | Description |
| :-------- | :----- | :---------- |
| --id | 0 - 64 | The ID of this client/target. This value defaults to 0 (zero) which means "act on all messages regardless of intended target". |
| --test | *none* | Bind to /dev/null instead of /dev/pi-blaster when setting color values. Useful for testing. |
| --daemon | *none* | Only listen for UDP messages. The keypress and display thread is not started. |

## Setup

* GPIO Pins - The code has three pins (defaults to 23, 24, 25) set up as Red, Green, and Blue respectively. These are the GPIO numbers not the connector pin numbers. They are set at the top of the source and do require a recompile if changed.

## UDP Messages

Each message consists of a one byte (8 bits) command, eight bytes (64 bits) for the target IDs, four bytes (32 bits) for the message ID, followed by the appropriate data. Target IDs is a bit field which allows up to 64 targets to be commanded from one broadcast message. Multiple targets can have the same ID. Valid target IDs therefore are from 0 to 64 with a target ID of 0 meaning "all targets".

| Name | Value | Description |
| :--- | ----: | :---------- |
| CMD_OFF | 0x00 | Turn off all colors (i.e. terminate auto patterns and set values to zero) |
| CMD_SETLEVELS | 0x01 | Message contains data to set one full color triplet (R,G,B) and rest value |
| CMD_AUTOPATTERN | 0x02 | Message contains data containing a ramp time along with NumColors number of color triplets to cycle between. |
| CMD_AUTODISABLE | 0x03 | Message contains only the command (no extra data) and stops any current auto-cycling pattern. |

### CMD_OFF
| Name | Description | Type | Bits |
| :--- | :---------- | :--- | ---: |
| CMD  | This is the command action to take | Unsigned Char | 8 |
| Targets | This is the target ID bitfield for the broadcast message. Set bits to 1 for each target which should accept this command | Unsigned Long Long | 64 |
| MessageID | This is used to identify and ignore duplicate messages. Due to the unreliable nature of UDP, and the slow embedded processors, sending multiple duplicate messages some few milliseconds (10) apart can help ensure the devices get all their messages | Unsigned Int | 32 |

### CMD_SETLEVELS
| Name | Description | Type | Bits |
| :--- | :---------- | :--- | ---: |
| CMD  | This is the command action to take | Unsigned Char | 8 |
| Targets | This is the target ID bitfield for the broadcast message. Set bits to 1 for each target which should accept this command | Unsigned Long Long | 64 |
| MessageID | This is used to identify and ignore duplicate messages. Due to the unreliable nature of UDP, and the slow embedded processors, sending multiple duplicate messages some few milliseconds (10) apart can help ensure the devices get all their messages | Unsigned Int | 32 |
| RampTime | This is the time in milliseconds over which the color will be changed | Unsigned Int | 32 |
| Red  | This is the level for the "red" GPIO pin. Values from 0.0 to 1.0 | Unsigned Char | 8 |
| Green  | This is the level for the "green" GPIO pin. Values from 0.0 to 1.0 | Unsigned Char | 8 |
| Blue  | This is the level for the "blue" GPIO pin. Values from 0.0 to 1.0 | Unsigned Char | 8 |

### CMD_AUTOPATTERN

The CMD, RampTime and NumColors value/bits are at the head of the message. The number of color triplets (R, G, B, RestTime) passed must be equal to NumColors.

| Name | Description | Type | Bits |
| :--- | :---------- | :--- | ---: |
| CMD  | This is the command action to take | Unsigned Char | 8 |
| Targets | This is the target ID bitfield for the broadcast message. Set bits to 1 for each target which should accept this command | Unsigned Long Long | 64 |
| MessageID | This is used to identify and ignore duplicate messages. Due to the unreliable nature of UDP, and the slow embedded processors, sending multiple duplicate messages some few milliseconds (10) apart can help ensure the devices get all their messages | Unsigned Int | 32 |
| RampTime | This is the time in milliseconds over which the color will be changed | Unsigned Int | 32 |
| NumColors | This is the number of color triplets in the message | Unsigned Char | 8 |
| Red  | This is the level for the "red" GPIO pin. Values from 0.0 to 1.0 | Unsigned Char | 8 |
| Green  | This is the level for the "green" GPIO pin. Values from 0.0 to 1.0 | Unsigned Char | 8 |
| Blue  | This is the level for the "blue" GPIO pin. Values from 0.0 to 1.0 | Unsigned Char | 8 |
| RestTime | This is the time in milliseconds to hold on this color after ramping | Unsigned Int | 32 |

### CMD_AUTODISABLE

| Name | Description | Type | Bits |
| :--- | :---------- | :--- | ---: |
| CMD  | This is the command action to take | Unsigned Char | 8 |
